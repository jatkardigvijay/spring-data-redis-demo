How to run:

Run the server i.e. the redis-server.exe file

then start the spring boot appln on the port specified in appln properties

based on the entity: save 4-5 products and then test for the cacahbility

This is the demo for the spring boot redis (as a db) crud and the caching capability.

Redis can also be used as a message broker (In my POC message broker demo not shown as I used Rabbit MQ for the message Queues)
